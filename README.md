# Convolution-Networks

Created a simple convolution network that models the retinal ganglion receptive field. My hope going forward is to gather real data from the recptor fields in retinas and apply it to the colvolution network. Working towards making a library that takes any size input image and tranforms it based on what we know about retinal cells.
